# eOS — Proof of Concept

eOS is a community-driven proof-of-concept for a **common, free operating system for the European public sector**.  
It’s based on **Fedora Linux**, comes with **GNOME (and KDE Plasma for testing)**, and integrates container technologies. The goal is simple: give public institutions a modern, reliable, and open platform they can all share.

## Why eOS?

There are hundreds of Linux distributions out there, but the public sector in Europe still lacks a **common baseline**.  
eOS tries to answer that with:

- **A shared foundation** — one Linux base for everyone  
- **Layered flexibility** — national, regional, or sector-specific add-ons on top  
- **Privacy by design** — no tracking, no hidden reporting  
- **Sustainability** — runs well on new machines and doesn’t abandon older hardware  

It’s not “yet another distro” — it’s more of a **proposal for collaboration**.

## Features at a Glance

- **Unified**: standardized tools, common desktop  
- **Secure**: open-source, transparent, no data collection  
- **Self-governed**: designed for EU public institutions, not corporations  
- **Polished**: efficient, usable, works across device generations

## Goals

The bigger picture behind eOS:

- Create a **common Linux base** for the EU public sector  
- Provide a **clear governance model** so institutions can steer development  
- Encourage **interoperability and open standards**  
- Keep IT infrastructure **cost-effective and future-proof**

## Getting Started

Right now, this is still a **proof-of-concept**, not a finished product.
