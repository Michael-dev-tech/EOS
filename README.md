# eOS — Proof of Concept

eOS is a community-driven proof-of-concept for a **common, free operating system for the European public sector**.  
It’s based on **Fedora 42**, ships with **GNOME as the default desktop** (KDE Plasma is also tested), and comes with **container tools (Podman)** baked in.  

The idea isn’t to reinvent Linux, but to offer a **ready-to-go setup for public administrations** that is secure, sustainable, and community-governed.

## Why eOS?

There are countless Linux distributions, but none designed as a **shared baseline for the EU public sector**. eOS proposes:

- **A shared foundation** — one Linux base for everyone  
- **Layered flexibility** — national, regional, or sector-specific add-ons  
- **Privacy by design** — no telemetry, no hidden reporting  
- **Sustainability** — efficient on new hardware, still usable on older machines  

It’s less about “yet another distro” and more about **collaboration around a common standard**.

## Features at a Glance

- **Unified**: standardized tools and a common desktop experience  
- **Secure**: open-source, transparent, and privacy-friendly  
- **Self-governed**: built for institutions, not vendors  
- **Polished**: smooth on both modern and legacy devices

## What’s This About?

eOS isn’t a brand-new operating system. It’s essentially **Fedora 42 + GNOME**, preconfigured with sane defaults and container tools, tailored for governments, NGOs, and organizations that want a **ready-to-deploy Linux environment**.

Think of it as a **template OS**: reliable, boring in a good way, and easy to build upon.

- RAM: 2 GB (realistically, 4 GB is the baseline)  
- Storage: 15 GB (SSD highly recommended)  
- Display: 1024×768  

### Recommended (smooth experience)
- CPU: Modern dual-core, 2 GHz+  
- RAM: 4–8 GB  
- Storage: 25 GB+ on SSD  
- Display: 1080p or better
